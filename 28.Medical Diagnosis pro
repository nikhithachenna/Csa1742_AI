% Rule to find possible diseases based on symptoms
possible_diseases(Symptoms, Diseases) :-
    % Find all possible diseases for each symptom
    findall(Disease, 
        (member(Symptom, Symptoms), symptom(Symptom, DiseasesForSymptom), member(Disease, DiseasesForSymptom)), 
        AllDiseases),
    % Find unique diseases
    list_to_set(AllDiseases, UniqueDiseases),
    % Filter diseases that match all symptoms
    filter_diseases(UniqueDiseases, Symptoms, Diseases).

% Helper predicate to filter diseases that match all symptoms
filter_diseases([], _, []).
filter_diseases([Disease | RestDiseases], Symptoms, [Disease | FilteredRest]) :-
    matches_all_symptoms(Disease, Symptoms),
    filter_diseases(RestDiseases, Symptoms, FilteredRest).
filter_diseases([_ | RestDiseases], Symptoms, FilteredRest) :-
    filter_diseases(RestDiseases, Symptoms, FilteredRest).

% Check if a disease matches all given symptoms
matches_all_symptoms(Disease, Symptoms) :-
    forall(member(Symptom, Symptoms), 
        (symptom(Symptom, DiseasesForSymptom), member(Disease, DiseasesForSymptom))).

% Convert a list to a set (remove duplicates)
list_to_set(List, Set) :-
    sort(List, Set).

% Example queries
% ?- possible_diseases([fever, cough], Diseases).
